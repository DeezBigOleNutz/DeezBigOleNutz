  What's Happening Holmes! I'm DeezBigOleNutz, not to be confused with my dad DeezBigOleHarryNutz. I'm teaching 
myself Linux, and what I've taught myself so far, let me tell you..I love it! I'm currently learning Termux, and again, what I've taught myself...
I love It! I'm hands down the best in my class. I'm willing to collaborate with anyone needing someone to do the grunt work that noone else wants to do just to learn.
 You can reach me @ jamiebeck33@gmail.com  or beckjamesbi3ch@gmail.com and I'm looking forward to working with you
